# Design Document #

This application is an infix calculator that can do 4 basic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division on the operands 0-9. It also includes a short splash screen with an intro sound, a blank second page, and a test splash button for the sake of learning/understanding Android Studio. The calculator product itself is to be used for basic arithmetic. 

System Design
=============

![alt text](/app/src/main/res/drawable/project1snip1.png)


This is where you specify all of the system's requirements. This section should accurately portray the complete operation of your application. Provide scenarios, use cases, system requirements, and diagrams/screenshots of the system.


Usage
=====
Open the application from your device. Use operands 0-9 and operators to perform basic arithmetic in an infix or postfix notation.
Below are examples of both.

Infix notation  : 5 * 7

Postfix notation: 5 7 *

Both result in the same value of 35
