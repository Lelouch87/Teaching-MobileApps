============

This application is a photo filter that can either load a picture from the devices storage to manipulate or take 
a new picture from the app to manipulate. This application has simple photo filters that make the photo a different
color. It also includes some filters that take forever, but perform a deeper manipulation of the picture.

System Design
=============

![Main menu](/src/res/raw/project2_opening_screen.PNG)

Application targeted version is Nougat 7.0 - 7.1.2
Any android system can run this application


Usage
=====

Open the application from your device. Either press the bottom left button to load a picture from your device or press
the bottom right button to take a new picture to manipulate. Once you have your picture, it should display in the
middle of the application. From here you can use the horizontal scroll bar at the top and choose which effects you
would like. Be careful! Effects compound on each other so be sure to use the Restore button in the middle of the bottom
in order to reset your picture back to the original.
